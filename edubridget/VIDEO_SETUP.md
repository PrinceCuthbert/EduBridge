# Video Background Setup Instructions

## Required Video File

The Hero section now uses a background video for a modern, engaging experience.

### Video Specifications:
- **File name**: `education-background.mp4`
- **Location**: Place in `/public/` folder (same location as `Students.png`)
- **Recommended specs**:
  - Resolution: 1920x1080 (1080p)
  - Duration: 10-30 seconds (will loop)
  - Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
  - File size: 5-10 MB (optimized for web)
  - Content: Education-related footage (classroom, students studying, East African campus, etc.)

### Content Suggestions:
- Students collaborating in a classroom
- Graduation ceremonies
- Library or study spaces
- Campus life in East Africa
- Close-ups of books, learning materials
- **Important**: Should be dimmed/desaturated or shot in soft lighting so text remains readable

### Fallback Behavior:
If the video file is not present, the Hero section will automatically fall back to:
1. The existing `Students.png` image as a poster
2. A gradient background overlay

### Where to Find Royalty-Free Education Videos:
- **Pexels Videos**: https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/education/
- **Pixabay Videos**: https://pixabay.com/videos/search/classroom/
- **Unsplash (via Coverr)**: https://coverr.co/
- Search terms: "education", "classroom africa", "students studying", "university campus"

### Installation:
1. Download your chosen video
2. Rename it to: `education-background.mp4`
3. Place it in: `public/education-background.mp4`
4. Refresh your browser - the video should auto-play in the Hero section background

### Alternative (If you don't have a video):
The design still looks great with just the gradient fallback! The glassmorphic overlays and modern styling work beautifully even without the video.
